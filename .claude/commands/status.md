description: One-page portfolio dashboard across all your published packages — version, last publish, weekly downloads, OIDC trust state, recent commits, drift (unreleased commits), open GitHub issues, CI health. Triggers from prompts like "how are my packages doing", "show me the dashboard", "what's pending release", "anything published recently", "morning check", "weekly check". Read-only.

# Status

Read-only snapshot of your npm portfolio. Replaces the "open 5 browser
tabs to check on my packages" morning ritual with one command.

## When to use

- Daily session start: "what's my portfolio doing?"
- Weekly review: "what shipped, what's pending?"
- Pre-release sanity: "are my other packages healthy before I ship this one?"
- After a CVE landing: "show me everything published recently — anything I
  need to bump?"

## How it works

Three phases. Read-only — no state changes, no commits, no API mutations.

- **Phase 1** — discover packages from the workspace (or an explicit `--scope`).
- **Phase 2** — fan out concurrent fetches: npm registry, downloads API,
  GitHub repo + CI, local git, npm-trust doctor.
- **Phase 3** — render a single markdown table + action hints.

## Phase 1 — Discover packages

Default: workspace-aware via `npm-trust --doctor --json` (already invoked
in Phase 2 for trust state — reuse the output).

```bash
pnpm exec npm-trust --doctor --json --workflow release.yml 2>/dev/null
```

The JSON's `workspace.packages[]` is the list. Each entry has `{ name,
version, dir, private }`. Skip entries with `private: true`.

If the workspace is single-package, the list has one entry.

If `--doctor` isn't available (older CLI), fall back to:

- Single-package: read `package.json#name`
- pnpm workspace: walk `pnpm-workspace.yaml#packages` globs, read each `package.json#name`
- npm/yarn workspace: walk `package.json#workspaces` globs

**Optional explicit scope mode**: if the user invokes `/solo-npm:status
--scope @myorg`, fetch the package list from the npm registry instead:

```bash
npm access list packages @myorg --json
```

(Useful for cross-cutting org-wide audits.)

## Phase 2 — Fan-out fetches

For each package, fetch in **parallel** (don't serialize):

### Per-package npm fetches

```bash
# Returns "version time.modified" — combined for one call:
npm view <pkg> --json
```

Parse: `version`, `time.modified`, `dist.attestations` (if present →
provenance ✓).

### Per-package downloads (unauthenticated, lenient)

```bash
curl -s "https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/last-week/<pkg>"
```

Returns `{ "downloads": <count>, "package": "<pkg>" }` or 404 (private
packages return 404 — show "—").

### Per-repo GitHub fetches

For each unique repo (dedup if multiple packages share a repo):

```bash
gh repo view <owner>/<repo> --json defaultBranchRef,issues,stargazerCount,url
gh run list --repo <owner>/<repo> --workflow release.yml --limit 1 \
   --json conclusion,headSha,startedAt,url
```

If the repo has > 30 published packages, batch with `gh api graphql`
instead.

### Per-repo local git

```bash
cd <repo_dir>
git log --since=7.days.ago --oneline
git tag --list 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1   # latest tag
git rev-list <latest_tag>..HEAD --count           # unreleased commits
```

The "unreleased commits" count is the **drift** signal: > 0 means main
is ahead of the latest published version.

### Trust state — read from cache, no live npm calls

Read `.solo-npm/state.json` if it exists.

For each package in the dashboard:

- `✓` if the package name is in `cache.trust.configured` AND the cache is fresh (`now - cache.trust.lastFullCheck < cache.trust.ttlDays`)
- `—` if package is unpublished
- `✗` if the package is NOT in `cache.trust.configured` (cache is the source of truth; if a package isn't tracked it's assumed not-yet-trust-configured)

If the cache is stale (last full check > `ttlDays` ago) OR missing,
surface a one-line note above the table:

> ⚠️ Trust state cache stale (last full check N days ago). Run
> `/release` or `/solo-npm:trust` to refresh.

This skill is **read-only and fast** — it does NOT call `npm-trust
--doctor` to get live trust state. The cache is populated by `/release`
and `/solo-npm:trust`. Status's job is to *show* state, not derive it.

## Phase 3 — Render

### Main table

Render as a markdown table:

```
| Package          | Version  | Published    | Downloads/wk | Trust | CI  | Drift     |
|------------------|----------|--------------|-------------:|:-----:|:---:|-----------|
| @ncbijs/eutils   | 0.4.0    | 19d ago      |        1,213 | ✓     | ✓   | 2 commits |
| @ncbijs/blast    | —        | (unpublished)|            — | —     | —   | ready     |
| rfc-bcp47        | 0.13.0   | 22d ago      |          348 | ✓     | ✓   | clean     |
| npm-trust        | 0.9.0    | today        |           87 | ✓     | ✓   | clean     |
```

Columns:
- **Package**: package name (or `name@scope`)
- **Version**: latest on registry, or `—` for unpublished
- **Published**: relative time (`today`, `Nd ago`, `Nm ago`)
- **Downloads/wk**: from the unauthenticated downloads API
- **Trust**: `✓` configured; `—` unpublished; `✗` published-untrusted
- **CI**: latest workflow run conclusion (`✓` success, `✗` failure, `~`
  in_progress, `—` no runs)
- **Drift**: `clean`, `N commits` (unreleased), or `ready` (unpublished
  with local content)

### Open issues section

Below the table:

```
Open issues:
  - 1 in @ncbijs/eutils — "Citation parsing fails for…" (#14)
  - 0 in rfc-bcp47
  - 0 in npm-trust
```

Hide repos with 0 issues from the per-line list; instead summarize
`Open issues: 1 total across 1 repo` if all but one are clean.

### Recent activity section

```
Recent activity (last 7d):
  - rfc-bcp47:    3 commits, 0 releases
  - ncbijs:       9 commits, 1 release (v0.4.0 of @ncbijs/eutils)
  - npm-trust:    1 commit,  1 release (v0.9.0)
```

### Action hints section

For each detected drift, surface an actionable hint:

```
Action hints:
  • @ncbijs/eutils has 2 unreleased commits in ncbijs → /release ready?
  • @ncbijs/blast is local-only at v0.1.0 → /solo-npm:init for first publish?
```

Hint mapping:

| Detected | Hint |
|---|---|
| Drift > 0 commits | "→ /release ready?" |
| Unpublished package with local content | "→ /solo-npm:init for first publish?" |
| Unpublished package with no local tag | (no hint — not actionable) |
| Trust ✗ (published-untrusted) | "→ /solo-npm:trust to configure OIDC" |
| CI failure on latest run | "→ check `<gh run url>`; retry or fix" |
| Latest publish > 90 days ago | (no hint — informational only) |

## Output behavior

This skill is read-only. Do NOT call `AskUserQuestion`; do NOT chain
into other skills. Just render the dashboard + hints. The user decides
what to do next.

If the user explicitly types `/solo-npm:status` and then immediately
invokes another skill (e.g., `/release`), each skill is invoked
independently — `status` does not orchestrate the follow-up.

## Sharp edges

- **GitHub API rate limits.** Cap per-invocation at ~30 repos. If more,
  fall back to a `gh api graphql` bulk query for issue + CI counts. The
  skill should detect rate-limit errors and surface them rather than
  silently failing.
- **Private packages** return 404 from the public downloads API. Render
  `—` for downloads on private packages.
- **No `gh` auth.** If `gh auth status` fails, surface a one-line
  notice ("`gh` is not authenticated; CI + issue columns will show `?`")
  and continue with the rest of the data.
- **Slow first run.** With ~15 packages × ~3 fetches each, expect 5-10s
  on a fresh run. The npm and downloads APIs are unauthenticated and
  fast; `gh` calls dominate.
- **Stale cache.** v0.5.0 doesn't cache — every invocation fetches
  fresh. Future: add `--cache 1h` flag for re-runs in the same session.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT mutate state. No commits, no publishes, no `gh issue close`.
- Does NOT chain into other skills. Just suggests next-step skills via
  hints.
- Does NOT fetch private/auth-gated data beyond what `gh auth` already
  has access to.
- Does NOT replace `gh dash` or other rich-UI dashboards — it's
  terminal-friendly markdown.
- Does NOT track historical trends across runs (that would require a
  cache layer).
